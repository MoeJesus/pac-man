# Pac-Man in Python

My attempt at recreating the classic version of Pac-Man within python using the [Pxyel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) library.

The guide I followed comes from [LeMaster Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H27CimgPsQ). Thank you for your guide.

This version is currently on hiatus indefinitely and will probably never be finished.

I have moved on to [Pac-Man 2.0](https://github.com/MoeJesus/pac-man-2.0). Please follow that repository to see a more completed game.
